Lack of internal systems availability block employee productivity and add to the financial burden. Thus, it is critical to have a healthy, performant, resilient IT structure serving as a backbone of conducting your business. But there are no textbook solutions to achieving five 9s availability. Data redundancy, computing clusters, load balancing, fail-over mechanisms, each of these individually addresses one potential issue, but none treats systems in your organisation holistically for maximising business revenue.

The best way to make it fit is to train it, by monitoring metrics just like you would monitor your progress when training or doing a sport. Once known goals can be set and training can start. We train the application, train the team, train the clients but most of all, we train ourselves in the process, train all the time to be better, to know better, to have better and qualitative delivered results and to bring the application performance successfully to the finish line. We faced different challenges along the testing path, from requirements definition to implementation, context understanding to test planning, tool adoption to test lab construction, test metrics to test measurement and monitoring. We experienced and learned how to find the best approach for our product in order to adapt and use application performance best practices at each level of testing, to analyze each metrics and to simulate requests and monitor them. We managed to set up a continuous performance testing environment that enables running all type of tests at every code commit, having reusable and maintainable test architecture, distributed test run in a cloud environment, measuring metrics and collecting results, automatically analyze and generate reports and identify possible performance degradation, with just a click away.

Have you ever seen an audit report like this before? - I'll change it immediately. - A complete waste of time and money. This shall never happen again! And then he left. John was shocked.

There was something wrong with the audit report and I don't even know what … Can you review my report before I send it back to my CEO? - Sure. I can also help you build one from scratch if you want. I've done many audits. In the situation above there are at least two processes: - How can John make the best audit report? (Hard skills) - How can John manage this kind of conflictual situations?

Large enterprises are a different and a more difficult environment as organizational practices & structures are harder to change. This is due to a number of organizational factors, including culture, governance and financial management, the application of portfolio and program management strategies that do not take advantage of the unique characteristics of software. So adopting lean practices is much more complicated. Releases are done somewhat infrequently and often there is no need to put out releases or features quickly. Our presentation will look at what Continuous Delivery & Test automation has to offer for enterprises and proposes approaches to adopt these techniques. Who has the ownership? How to involve all the important business stakeholders in the process? How to make it reliable?  How to prove the  benefits with business metrics? What are the threats?

Internet Explorer.. EA games... Facebook and so on, can be easily linked to a word (slow, not finished, social). One big aspect that influences if an application has a good key-word is its performance: how fast / well does it do what it does. The best way to make it fit is to train it, by monitoring metrics just like you would monitor your progress when training or doing a sport. Once known goals can be set and training can start. We train the application, train the team, train the clients but most of all, we train ourselves in the process, train all the time to be better, to know better, to have better and qualitative delivered results and to bring the application performance successfully to the finish line. We faced different challenges along the testing path, from requirements definition to implementation, context understanding to test planning, tool adoption to test lab construction, test metrics to test measurement and monitoring. We experienced and learned how to find the best approach for our product in order to adapt and use application performance best practices at each level of testing, to analyze each metrics and to simulate requests and monitor them. We managed to set up a continuous performance testing environment that enables running all type of tests at every code commit, having reusable and maintainable test architecture, distributed test run in a cloud environment, measuring metrics and collecting results, automatically analyze and generate reports and identify possible performance degradation, with just a click away. We would like to share with you our testing approach, a useful checklist of actionable knowledge. We want to exemplify (theoretical and practical) how we adapted our chosen methodologies and tools, how we continuously trained ourselves to achieve better and qualitative operations in the test performance process and what we have learned from our experience.

Using RBT only 2% to 3% of all defects found from the beginning of Unit Test are caused by bad requirements. In production most releases are at or near zero defects. This presentation will provide an overview for the “Requirements Based Testing” process and will highlight the importance of the Cause & Effect Graphing, one of the most powerful Black Box testing techniques for designing test cases, that the RBT process is based on.","speakers":[{"photo":"cristi.olariu.png","name":"Cristian Olariu","title":"QA Engineer","company":"","companyUrl":"","bio":"Cristian Olariu has 8 years of Software testing experience and about 4 years of experience in writing requirements.

However, between these two fields of activity – UX and testing – an interdependence relationship had been established, up to the point that there are certain issues regarding the blurring of the line between the terms related to each field, which might hinder the communication between the specialist and the product itself. Therefore, there are some questions to be asked: What makes these two fields of activity rely on each other? Why are specialists required to learn and work with the terms used by both fields (e.g. as a testing specialist one also needs to be familiar with UX)?

Have you ever seen an audit report like this before? - I'll change it immediately. - A complete waste of time and money. This shall never happen again! And then he left. John was shocked. This was the first time he had something meaningful to do in his new job. During the lunch break, he said to his good old friend, an experienced consultant in IT management: - My first two weeks as an IT Manager … And my boss has already yelled at me. There was something wrong with the audit report and I don't even know what … Can you review my report before I send it back to my CEO? - Sure. I can also help you build one from scratch if you want. I've done many audits. In the situation above there are at least two processes: - How can John make the best audit report? (Hard skills) - How can John manage this kind of conflictual situations? (Soft skills). The second question will trigger the most important process. Is his boss going to yell again? How should John react?

Customer-facing IT failures mean directly losing customer revenue and trust, as users have grown accustomed to easily switching service providers for more reliable ones. Lack of internal systems availability block employee productivity and add to the financial burden. Thus, it is critical to have a healthy, performant, resilient IT structure serving as a backbone of conducting your business. But there are no textbook solutions to achieving five 9s availability. Data redundancy, computing clusters, load balancing, fail-over mechanisms, each of these individually addresses one potential issue, but none treats systems in your organisation holistically for maximising business revenue. Silos are a clever method of grouping servers in such a way that they can be scaled both horizontally and vertically, depending on the actual application needs. Most importantly, it frees you from over-optimizing the architecture upfront, by allowing fine adjustments easy to integrate in your Agile workflow.","speakers":[{"photo":"georgianagligor.jpg","name":"Georgiana Gligor","title":"Large-scale application architect","company":"tekkie.ro","companyUrl":"http://www.tekkie.ro/","bio":"Having crafted professional software since 2003, Georgiana is living proof that geek girls are an asset to any tech team.
