Tensiunea asta ne poate consuma, ne poate șterge, ne poate transforma în niște plictisitori, sau ne poate face să explodăm în fața altora în cele mai neașteptate momente.

A practical approach of Transactional Analysis.","description":"When people opinions differ, and there's a stake involved, it's easy for a simple conversation to escalate into a conflict. This session proposes a couple of day-to-day scenarios where an IT engineer gets in a conflict with a stakeholder. As always, conflicts have the potential to generate wrong consequences, so we'll be giving a helpful hand on applying the Transactional Analysis (TA) theory in order to turn the conflict back into a conversation. TA considers that when communicating, people act as \"Parent\", \"Adult\" or \"Child\" and remaining on the same state can lead to failure. This theory also offers means to change own and other's attitude towards a conversation.","speakers":["Dan Carja"],"speakingLang":"Romanian","level":"Intermediate"},{"startTime":"12:00:00","endTime":"12:45:00","allTracks":false,"track":"Room 5","title":"Game Design: Satisfaction vs Frustration","description":"It is important, when designing experiences for video games, to ensure that the players never feel frustration.

But, have you ever wondered, how does this magic work?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we'll try to unravel the magic behind type inference using a small subset of Standard ML as the vehicle language and Scala as the implementation language.\r\n","speakers":["Ionuț G.
