So, at the end of August that year, together with a friend, we decided to focus on reaching testers in four different towns in Romania by organising one-day Peer Conferences. This was a big effort, but I think it finally paid off: we were able to find passionate testers in each location that are willing to organise monthly meetings where people can talk about testing.<br/>The fact that I interact a lot with clients through my role at Altom and with actual testers through the testing community allows me to get a better view on how testing is seen both from the outside and form the inside.

We introduce a highly innovative yet intriguingly simple approach by which source control meta-data is used to assess the quality of a software system without actually analysing the code itself. In fact, the biggest benefit of this approach is that it breaks the constraints of language-dependent analysis techniques and tools: all source files are analysed together independent of their programming language, and quality issues are reported even for files that are ignored by traditional code quality tools (e.g. configuration files, SQL files) In this session we will demonstrate how a multitude of anti-patterns can be detected strictly based on the source-control meta-data. We will show detection techniques referring to unusual patterns of change, like files with a sudden growth or a high frequency of changes, files with insufficient amount of refactoring, etc. We will also discuss how team anomalies can be detected (e.g. unstable teams, too many developers working at the same time on the same file, or files with a high risk of knowledge loss due to developers having left the project). Furthermore, we will see how source-control meta-data can be used to get quickly a rough understanding of an unknown code base; this includes an overview of the technologies being used, the dynamics of the project’s team, the developers that have the best understanding of the system, and the quality hotspots of a project. We will also show how information visualisation techniques can help us to explore efficiently this wealth of data, for example the distribution of anti-patterns or technologies across the system.","speakers":[{"photo":"radu.marinescu.jpg","name":"Radu Marinescu","title":"Group Manager for Code Quality","company":"Endava","companyUrl":"http://www.endava.com","bio":"Radu Marinescu is Group Manager for Code Quality at Endava, where he aims to make code quality part of Endava’s organisational DNA.

It’s the others that can / have to fix the problems. Not them. Specifically, one aspect that I often hear testers complain about, is that the tester is being seen as the inferior species in the software development environment. When I ask them why they don’t do anything to change this view in their company / project, I get the answer that the managers / developers need to change for this to be fixed. 8 years ago I began a journey to change the mindset on testing, which started with changing my own. My talk is about how I, together with my business partners, managed to change our mindset on testing, to escape the ISTQB land and discover a world full of learning opportunities. It’s about how we managed to create an environment where our colleagues feel good about what they do, want to improve their testing skills and don’t think to change their career in the next 3 years. Our road was not at all smooth. To give just one example, when we thought we had started quite well, in one month we lost 75% of our team. This made us redefine how we hired people, how we trained them and how we worked with them. It also allowed us to learn that sometimes it’s better to let people go. Another important aspect of this journey is how we went beyond our office walls and, together with some fellow testers, started a community for testers in Romania. A place where people can learn from each other, where they can speak up, where they can get feedback from their peers. We started by organising 4 one day peer conferences in the 4 main IT towns in Romania, and tried to plant the community seed. And then we left each seed germinate at its own pace. When they felt ready to flower, we offered support and then allowed them to grow in their own rhythm. Currently monthly meetings are organised in each of the 4 towns with various presentations, exercises, hands-on events, all related to testing. Besides that, community members organise from time to time elaborated workshops on technical topics. This is a story about how I’ve started on this road by working on changing my own mindset and continued by forming a testing community open to learning, where other testers can experience the change themselves as well.","speakers":[{"photo":"alexandru.rotaru.jpg","name":"Alexandru Rotaru","title":"Managing Partner","company":"","companyUrl":"","bio":"For the past 8 years I've been working with Altom Consulting, a Software Testing Consultancy company based in Romania.<br/>Being a small company, my role and tasks vary a lot. I work as a test engineer / test lead at customer's site on fixed length projects, I do administrative tasks, I do interviews and training sessions, I interact a lot with current and potential clients to try to understand their needs and problems. This makes it a great learning experience!<br/><br/>When I attended CAST in 2011 I loved the idea of an active testing community and the LAWST format. So, at the end of August that year, together with a friend, we decided to focus on reaching testers in four different towns in Romania by organising one-day Peer Conferences. This was a big effort, but I think it finally paid off: we were able to find passionate testers in each location that are willing to organise monthly meetings where people can talk about testing.<br/>The fact that I interact a lot with clients through my role at Altom and with actual testers through the testing community allows me to get a better view on how testing is seen both from the outside and form the inside.

For example, they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020. Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields, and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed. In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet repositories and then performed simple static analysis. Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially at large scale. Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and device classes. We were also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and classification of both firmware images and live devices. This material is both important and innovative because it addresses the more and more pressing matter of securing/hacking the IoT, hence the embedded devices themselves. Moreover, it's envisioned that the topic will go in the next few years from important to critically important. This material is definitely innovative because it will provide technical aspects of security research by combining several interesting research directions: - non-x86 emulation (and the caveats) - some aspects of static and dynamic analysis - machine learning - device fingerprinting This material is significant because it will present the results, knowledge and insights that resulted from three years of experimentation and work using systematic, methodological and academic approaches.

It’s the others that can / have to fix the problems. Not them. Specifically, one aspect that I often hear testers complain about, is that the tester is being seen as the inferior species in the software development environment. When I ask them why they don’t do anything to change this view in their company / project, I get the answer that the managers / developers need to change for this to be fixed. 8 years ago I began a journey to change the mindset on testing, which started with changing my own. My talk is about how I, together with my business partners, managed to change our mindset on testing, to escape the ISTQB land and discover a world full of learning opportunities. It’s about how we managed to create an environment where our colleagues feel good about what they do, want to improve their testing skills and don’t think to change their career in the next 3 years. Our road was not at all smooth. To give just one example, when we thought we had started quite well, in one month we lost 75% of our team. This made us redefine how we hired people, how we trained them and how we worked with them. It also allowed us to learn that sometimes it’s better to let people go. Another important aspect of this journey is how we went beyond our office walls and, together with some fellow testers, started a community for testers in Romania. A place where people can learn from each other, where they can speak up, where they can get feedback from their peers. We started by organising 4 one day peer conferences in the 4 main IT towns in Romania, and tried to plant the community seed. And then we left each seed germinate at its own pace. When they felt ready to flower, we offered support and then allowed them to grow in their own rhythm. Currently monthly meetings are organised in each of the 4 towns with various presentations, exercises, hands-on events, all related to testing. Besides that, community members organise from time to time elaborated workshops on technical topics. This is a story about how I’ve started on this road by working on changing my own mindset and continued by forming a testing community open to learning, where other testers can experience the change themselves as well.","speakers":[{"photo":"alexandru.rotaru.jpg","name":"Alexandru Rotaru","title":"Managing Partner","company":"","companyUrl":"","bio":"For the past 8 years I've been working with Altom Consulting, a Software Testing Consultancy company based in Romania.<br/>Being a small company, my role and tasks vary a lot. I work as a test engineer / test lead at customer's site on fixed length projects, I do administrative tasks, I do interviews and training sessions, I interact a lot with current and potential clients to try to understand their needs and problems. This makes it a great learning experience!<br/><br/>When I attended CAST in 2011 I loved the idea of an active testing community and the LAWST format. So, at the end of August that year, together with a friend, we decided to focus on reaching testers in four different towns in Romania by organising one-day Peer Conferences. This was a big effort, but I think it finally paid off: we were able to find passionate testers in each location that are willing to organise monthly meetings where people can talk about testing.<br/>The fact that I interact a lot with clients through my role at Altom and with actual testers through the testing community allows me to get a better view on how testing is seen both from the outside and form the inside. This also gives me the unique opportunity to reach both ends in order to change their mindset on software testing.","order":"z","orderKey":"zAlexandru Rotaru"}],"language":"English","level":"200 - Intermediate"}},{"timeSlot":{"code":"timeslot1","start":"2016-05-23T08:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-05-23T08:45:00.000Z","displayTracks":false},"track":{"code":"track11","name":"Room 11 (Track: BA/PM)","description":"(60 seats, floor 11)"},"session":{"hidden":false,"code":"11-1","title":"Use uncertainty to win business","description":"When a company fails to win new business, the first thing hurt is the forecasted profit and, out of this, a great deal of collateral damage is made.

For example, they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020. Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields, and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed. In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet repositories and then performed simple static analysis. Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially at large scale. Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and device classes. We were also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and classification of both firmware images and live devices. This material is both important and innovative because it addresses the more and more pressing matter of securing/hacking the IoT, hence the embedded devices themselves. Moreover, it's envisioned that the topic will go in the next few years from important to critically important. This material is definitely innovative because it will provide technical aspects of security research by combining several interesting research directions: - non-x86 emulation (and the caveats) - some aspects of static and dynamic analysis - machine learning - device fingerprinting This material is significant because it will present the results, knowledge and insights that resulted from three years of experimentation and work using systematic, methodological and academic approaches. Audience will be presented with technical knowledge, demos, insights, lessons learned and open challenges.","speakers":[{"photo":"andrei.costin.jpg","name":"Andrei Costin","title":"Founder Firmware.RE, Independent Security Researcher","company":"","companyUrl":"","bio":"Andrei holds a PhD degree in \"Informatics and Networking\" from EURECOM/TelecomParisTech, where he successfully developed and defended his thesis on \"Large Scale Security Analysis of the Embedded Devices'Firmware\".

Currently, this wealth of historical information about projects is mostly ignored. During this session we will prove that these meta-data can reveal a lot about the quality of your code base but also your development process. We introduce a highly innovative yet intriguingly simple approach by which source control meta-data is used to assess the quality of a software system without actually analysing the code itself. In fact, the biggest benefit of this approach is that it breaks the constraints of language-dependent analysis techniques and tools: all source files are analysed together independent of their programming language, and quality issues are reported even for files that are ignored by traditional code quality tools (e.g. configuration files, SQL files) In this session we will demonstrate how a multitude of anti-patterns can be detected strictly based on the source-control meta-data. We will show detection techniques referring to unusual patterns of change, like files with a sudden growth or a high frequency of changes, files with insufficient amount of refactoring, etc. We will also discuss how team anomalies can be detected (e.g. unstable teams, too many developers working at the same time on the same file, or files with a high risk of knowledge loss due to developers having left the project). Furthermore, we will see how source-control meta-data can be used to get quickly a rough understanding of an unknown code base; this includes an overview of the technologies being used, the dynamics of the project’s team, the developers that have the best understanding of the system, and the quality hotspots of a project. We will also show how information visualisation techniques can help us to explore efficiently this wealth of data, for example the distribution of anti-patterns or technologies across the system.","speakers":[{"photo":"radu.marinescu.jpg","name":"Radu Marinescu","title":"Group Manager for Code Quality","company":"Endava","companyUrl":"http://www.endava.com","bio":"Radu Marinescu is Group Manager for Code Quality at Endava, where he aims to make code quality part of Endava’s organisational DNA.
