However, what does this mean for my existing codebase?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we show how you can refactor your traditional object-oriented Java to using FP features and APIs from Java 8 in a beneficial manner. We will discuss things like:\r\n\r\nHow to adapt to requirement changes using first-class functions.\r\nHow you can enhance code reusability using currying.\r\nHow you can make your code more robust by favouring immutability over mutability.\r\nHow you can reduce null pointer exceptions with Optional.","speakers":["Raoul-Gabriel Urma"],"speakingLang":"English","level":"Intermediate"},{"startTime":"10:00:00","endTime":"11:00:00","allTracks":false,"track":"Track 2","title":"Azure as the Internet for Things","description":"There are many definitions on what The Internet of Things exactly means but what they all have in common is that it is about a lot of devices and a lot of data.

References from the field will reveal some pitfalls and how they can be avoided.

You could save a lot of time here, or find the root cause more easily there. In this talk, you'll see what I learned from years of performance work in the field, which processes and tools work, and what I think can still be improved. First, we'll talk about anti-methods for performance investigations and the USE checklist for finding the performance bottleneck, applied specifically to Windows and .NET applications. Then, we'll talk about ideal performance investigation tools and which tools can satisfy these needs today, and review the power of Event Tracing for Windows for extracting hard-to-find information out of the system. Finally, we'll talk about dashboards and visualizations, and where the gaps are between figuring out an issue on one system and monitoring thousands of servers. Along the way, I'll take you on a tour of a couple of my most challenging performance investigations.","speakers":["Sasha Goldshtein"],"speakingLang":"English","level":"Intermediate"},{"startTime":"11:15:00","endTime":"12:15:00","allTracks":false,"track":"Track 2","title":"DDD and the Delicate Art of Building Software","description":"Introduced over a decade ago, DDD has evolved in many ways to follow the evolution of business and technology.
